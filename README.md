# Earth-Quake Explorer
## Overview

Earth-Quake Explorer is a web application that leverages Mapbox GL JS to provide an interactive globe-based interface for visualizing earthquake data. The application allows users to explore global earthquake occurrences, cluster information, and smoothly navigate the interactive 3D globe.

## Features

- **Globe Navigation:** Explore the globe using various navigation controls, including zoom, pan, and rotation.
- **Cluster Visualization:** Clusters represent groups of earthquake occurrences, enhancing visualization.
- **Dynamic Earthquake Data:** Real-time earthquake data is fetched from a GeoJSON source and dynamically rendered on the map.
- **Cluster Interaction:** Click on clusters to zoom in, revealing detailed information about individual earthquakes.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The project is built using React, providing a modular and component-based structure.
- **react-map-gl:** This library integrates Mapbox GL JS with React, facilitating the creation of interactive maps.
- **Mapbox GL JS:** A powerful JavaScript library for embedding customizable maps into web applications.
- **TypeScript:** The project uses TypeScript to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase, enhancing development productivity and code quality.
- **Vite:** A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves as the project's build and development environment.
